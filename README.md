Largest palindrome product

    From Project Euler Problem 4


A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

There are **2** tests, make the tests pass.

Once your tests pass, fix the text of the second tests so that it's true (fill in **A×B**).

(you'll need jasmine-node)
    npm install jasmine-node -g

run automated tests by running
    jasmine-node --autotest .
