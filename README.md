Largest palindrome product
===========
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

There are **2** tests, make the tests pass.

Once your tests pass, fix the text of the second tests so that it's true (fill in **A×B**).

## Getting Started
